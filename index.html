        <li>
          <span class="strong">Main Thrust</span>: Space

      <h2>Advanced Tips</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span class="strong">Hover</span>: Firing both auxiliary thrusters at the same time will nearly counteract gravity.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="strong">Sideways Shift</span>: Firing one tilt thruster and the opposite auxiliary thruster will shift the Aeros sideways while keeping it mostly upright.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="strong">Boost</span>: Firing both the auxiliary thrusters can give an extra boost to the main thruster. Fire all five non-reverse thrusters for maximum boost.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="strong">Physics-based Control</span>: If a tilt or auxiliary thruster is ever facing downwards, you can use it to generate a bit of lift.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p><span class="strong">Note</span>: There is currently an audio bug resulting in popping noises; a temporary patch-job has been implemented that significantly reduces the popping but makes the audio not always play. As this project is not the focus of my life the bug may not be fully fixed terribly soon. Apologies :/</p>

      This site was built out of the default Unity WebGL Player site generated by the Unity game engine. The page title, controls, tips, and some css were added; the tab title, content positioning, and some css were adjusted.
      The Icaria game was built as a project for the Project Boost section on the "Complete C# Unity Developer 3D: Learn to Code Making Games" online course by GameDev tv on the Udemy Website.
